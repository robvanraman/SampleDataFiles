show me last 5 traded bonds
select top 5 * from trades order by date desc

show me my last 5 missed bonds and by how much?
select top 5 * from trades t1 inner join trace t2 on t1.cusip = t2.cusip and t1.quantity = t2.quantity where 
client <> 'WFS'

what was the spread I missed those?
select top 5 cusip, t1.price-t2.price as spread from trades t1 inner join trace t2 on t1.cusip = t2.cusip and t1.quantity = t2.quantity where 
client <> 'WFS' 

who executed it for how much?
select top 5 client, t2.price as spread from trades t1 inner join trace t2 on t1.cusip = t2.cusip and t1.quantity = t2.quantity where 
client <> 'WFS'
