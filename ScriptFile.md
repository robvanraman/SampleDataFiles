**Raman** : We all know that in today's fast-paced world, businesses rely heavily on data-driven decisions to maintain a competitive edge. Organizations generate vast amounts of data, but as the saying goes, "data is like crude oil – it's valuable only if processed." Many Lines of Business (LOBs) have mountains of data but lack actionable insights and the ability to see through data patterns.

Typically, stakeholders must approach a development team to explain their requirements, initiating a lengthy Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This traditional process has lot of scope of improvement, often leading to delays and miscommunications.

Now, 
1. Imagine if we made insights readily available to stakeholders without a tech background.
2. Imagine a solution that could be used by multiple LOBs to fulfill their reporting needs without the exhaustive SDLC process.

**Enter Lumen AI** – our groundbreaking product designed to solve this very problem. Lumen AI is particularly beneficial for dynamic industries where timely decision-making is crucial. **Our primary objective is to make data insights accessible to non-technical stakeholders**, empowering them to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently.

**Over to you Partiban**

**Partiban** : 

We divided the the SDLC into 2 passes, development and onboarding, the first year would be full of development of the product and we will engage 3 dev's. we are only on spend for first year and non savings or revenue for 1st year.

2nd year onwards, its all on the **economy of scale mode** , the more we scale in term of apps the more we save,
we would start onboarding apps by lob and our savings will be in terms of relocating the dev's who work on reports and saving their license charges if any.
